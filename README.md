# cm108_ptt
A simple hacked-together PTT library for CM108 USB soundcards

This is code from the Hamlib, which I simplified and made work standalone.
It has a very hackish style and should not be used for anything but
testing as it may have all kinds of weird bugs.

To build a test-tool which just pushes the PTT button for one second enter:

``` make ```
